## Story

It is a story of a brave adventurer and her name is Soha. She is in search of a ancient priceless goblet made of gold and red diamond. Soha is extraordinarily talented and can move very fast. She can hop over any fences or long distance. In search of the goblet, she travels through forest full of dinos and a desert full of zombies. Her main aim is to collect all the ruby that are placed over dangerous traps. Enemies are dangerous and traps are all over the places. It is going to be a dangerous road ahead for our player. Can anyone reach the priceless goblet? Answer can be found only by playing.
