## Story

It is a story of a brave adventurer and her name is Soha. She is in search of an ancient priceless goblet which is made of gold and a red diamond. Soha is extraordinarily talented and she can move very fast. She can hop over any fences or long distances. In search of the goblet, she travels through a forest full of dinosaurs and a desert full of zombies. Her main aim is to collect all the rubies that are placed over dangerous traps. Enemies are ferocious and traps are all over the place. It is going to be a menacing road ahead for Soha. Can anyone reach the priceless goblet? The answer can be found only by playing.
